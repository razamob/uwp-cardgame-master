High Trick Pony is similar to the popular game War
Essentially, the player with the highest card wins the round
The Deal button deals the cards to all the players
The Flip button flips all the players cards
The winner is the one that is the first to win 5 rounds
(In Single player mode the difficulty can be changed.  The house
needs 6, 5 and 4 wins in Beginner, Amateur and Expert respectively)
Good luck!
